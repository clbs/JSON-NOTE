# JSON-NOTE
generates a json file with notes
This is a backend for generating a note/comment section using a JSON file in lieu of a database.
This accepts two arguments. The fist argument is the title of the note, the second is the note content.
In my use, a PHP file is sending the arguments through a web site.

The output section can be changed from printing to generating HTML
